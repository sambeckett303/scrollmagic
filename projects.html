				Startup Essentials & Human Centered Computing</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:100px;margin-right:100px">While I was taking a "Startup Essentials" course, a friend and I had an idea for a new social media website. The course spent a lot of time focusing on "getting out of the building" and interviewing people. After the course was over, I spent a couple hours a week for my "Human Centered Computing" class working on designing out this website idea farther. So far, I've done the basics of the front end and back end. For the front end, I have professional looking UI mockups that link together. For the back end, I've designed the table layout and I've created a list of all the SQL calls I will need.</p>
